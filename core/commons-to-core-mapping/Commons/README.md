Commons Ontology Library Specification and Ontologies

The Commons Library is designed to provide a useful set of modeling constructs that are reusable in different modeling and data deployment environments with minimal commitments. It is intended to be extensible such that new ontologies and potentially other models (for example, UML models corresponding to the ontologies) can be added as cross-domain requirements present themselves. These requirements may come from other OMG standards efforts or potentially from external users of the library, for example, the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) manufacturing community, an EDM Council project with the Pistoia Alliance IDMP pharmaceutical community, and others.

Ontologies and other models will be identified primarily by drawing on other work, although care must be taken to ensure that intellectual property and other legal rights are addressed and that standardization is desired by the user community. Oversight for curation of the library will be managed by the Commons task force (RTF) via the normal OMG process. The minimum criteria identified to date for inclusion include: (1) the need for the same set of concepts with the same semantics across multiple specifications and/or domain areas, such as manufacturing, finance and/or retail, (2) a clear set of use cases, competency questions, and test cases that can help limit the scope for a given ontology and provide the basis for regression testing, (4) reusability in their own right with minimal dependencies on other ontologies with the possible exception of other Commons ontologies, and (4) that the ontologies meet minimal requirements for metadata, logical consistency, and serialization (e.g., RDF/XML and Turtle serialized OWL, for OWL ontologies).
