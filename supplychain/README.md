# SupplyChainOntology
Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO) aims to represent the most generic categories of entities and relationships in the domain of supply chain. The Supply Chain reference ontology can be extended to create application ontologies addressing the needs of specific use cases. SCRO uses BFO as the top-level ontology and some portions of the Common Core Ontology (CCO) as the mid-level ontology. 

SCRO.owl imports BFO-2020.owl, IOF.owl and IOF-AnnotationVocabulary.rdf (Imports folder). 

To open the Supply Chain ontology, perform the following steps:

Clone or download the repository
Navigate to the folder named SC Ontology 
Right click the file named SCRO.owl, click "Open With" and choose "Protege".
Protege might prompt you to manually find some files that the ontology imports. All relevant files can be found in the "Imports" folder.

SCRO is currenlty in draft status and it is not officially released yet.

This ontology is developed in the context of IOF Supply Chain Working Group activities. The short term objectives of the SC WG are to identify the requirements of the SCM reference ontology (an IOF ontology) and to provide formal and informal definitions for the important terms in supply chain domain. In the long term, we are planning  to develop the the SCM reference ontology (RO) and to develop a few application ontologies to validate the developed reference ontology. The Supply Chain (SC) WG is motivated by use cases such as supplier discovery (i.e., supplier capability matching with manufacturing requirements) and  traceability.
