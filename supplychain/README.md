# SupplyChainOntology
Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO) aims to represent the most generic categories of entities and relationships in the domain of supply chain. The Supply chain reference ontology can be extended to create application ontologies addressing the needs of specific use cases. SCRO uses BFO as the top-level ontology and some portions of the Common Core Ontology (CCO) as the mid-level ontology. 
SCRO is currenlty in draft status and it is not officially released yet.
