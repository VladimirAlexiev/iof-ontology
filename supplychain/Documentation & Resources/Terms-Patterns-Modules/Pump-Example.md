# Pump Use Case Description:
Consider an industrial water pump used in a cooling tower that has a type of mechanical seal as shown in the following image. Due to some residual stress in the seal (caused by nonuniform cooling during the casting process, for example), an internal crack forms and begins to grow gradually inside the seal. As the crack grows, the pump begins to operate with some unusual noise and mild vibration. However, the pump functions as intended (i.e., pumps water with the nominal pressure of 100 l/s as expected). After a few days, the crack reaches the surface of the seal. At this point, leaking begins and, as a result, the pump is only delivering 40 l/s.  Therefore, the pump is unable to perform its intended function to a desired level of performance. A request for service is initiated and a maintenance technician responds to the request and fixes the pump by replacing the seal and the pump begins to function normally as intended.

| Nonconforming Quality Stasis	| A Stasis in which an Artifact bears some Quality that fails to conform with the specifications of the Artifact|
| Fault (Defunct) Stasis	|A Stasis in which an Artifact no longer maintains some of its intended functions to a desired level of performance|
| Defective Stasis	| A Stasis in which an Artifact fails to meet its intended usage requirements| 
| Nominal Stasis	|A Stasis in which an Artifcat endures and all Qualities born by the Artifcat conform with the specifications and the Artifact meets intended usage requirements and functions as expected to a desired level of performance|
| Failure Process	|A Process that changes some Quality or Disposition born by an Artifact and causes the the Artifcat to become nonconforming, defective, or faulty|
| Failure Event	|A Process Boundary which is the boundary between some Failure Process and some Nonconfroming Quality Stasis or Fault Stasis or Defective Stasis|
| Functional Failure Event	|A Process Boundary which is the boundary between some Failure Process and some Fault Stasis|
